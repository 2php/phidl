# Patterned gold ground layer liftoff process

- PATTERN on stepper
    + Spin: P20 at 4000rpm, SPR 660 at 3000rpm
    + Bake: hotplate with vacuum contact at 95C for 1min
    + Expose: ASML 5500 100D; 180mJ/cm2
    + Post-exposure bake: 110C for 1min
    + Develop: 30s+30s double puddle
    + Inspect with microscope
- EVAPORATE: 5nm Ti + 50nm Au + 5nm Ti
    + Settings go here
    + Other stuff blah blah
- LIFTOFF in NMP
    + Soak in acetone briefly; liftoff is easy with this film.
    + Sonicate in dirty beaker until film is visibly removed from wafer. Then do 5 more minutes in dirty, 5 in clean.
