# WSi Deposition for SNSPDs

- PRECLEAN: O2 plasma at 60W, 50sccm O2 for 3min before loading wafer into AJA
- SPUTTER: 4.2nm WSi (cosputtered W + Si)
    -  Set 1.2mTorr; 10sccm Ar; 100W on W gun, 180W on Si gun
    -  Pre-soak guns for 2min; record voltage and current at 1min;
    -  Dep for 28 s
        - Voltage: ________________ V
        - Current: ________________ A
    -  Close shutter
- SPUTTER: 2nm aSi
    -  Set 10mTorr; 15sccm Ar
    -  Ramp Si gun 180W -> 475W
    -  Dep for 15 s
        - Voltage: ________________ V
        - Current: ________________ A
- MEASURE: Four point resistivity
    - Measured resistance R: ________________  Ohms
    - Sheet resistance Rs: For a large wafer Rs = R pi/ln(2) ~= 4.5R = ________________  Ohms/sq
